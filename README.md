# nginxproxymanager-py (`nginxproxymanager` on PyPI)

nginxproxymanager-py is a Python wrapper/scraper for the backend [Nginx Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/) API.

Supports both sync and async calls to each function.

Right now, this package only supports the following functions:
* Authentication
* Proxy host management
* User management
* Settings management
* API Status

In the future, the following features are planned. (Be warned- I'll probably add these as I need them in projects. Who knows how long that will take.)
* Redirection host management
* Dead host management
* Stream Management
* Access List Management
* SSL Certificate Management
